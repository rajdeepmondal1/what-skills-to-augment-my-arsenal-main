So after learning Ensemble learning, I loved the concept and thought of applying that idea to find my skills gap using ensemble of relevant skill data from the Indeed job posting. More like an wisdom of crowd approach. So I am aiming to find relevant skills that I should learn next before applying for my next Job to improve my odds of getting hired, and feel more confident."

        "## 2. Approach\n",
        "First we will download data from Indeed. I made a web scraper https://github.com/rajdeepmondal1/indeed-job-scraper that scrapes the https://in.indeed.com/ website for our essential data after searching for Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Science Consultant, Data Analyst and Machine Learning Engineer. Since the lines are blurry about what a Data Scientist does, we scrape data about these adjacent titles to remove bias in our data. Indeed website offers millions of searchable job listings, posted by understaffed employers. It has a built-in search engine, which allows us to filter the jobs by keyword. We will download the required information and store it in separate html files for the job listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to extract common data science and machine learning skills from the downloaded data. We’ll then compare these skills to our skills to determine which skills are missing. To reach our goal, we’ll proceed like this:\n",
        " - Parse out all the text from the downloaded HTML files.\n",
        " - Explore the parsed output to learn how job skills are commonly described in online postings. Perhaps specific HTML tags are more commonly used to underscore job skills.\n",
        " - Try to filter out any irrelevant job postings from our dataset. The search engine isn’t perfect. Perhaps some irrelevant postings were erroneously downloaded. We can evaluate relevance by comparing the postings with our skill list.\n",
        " - Cluster the job skills within the relevant postings, and visualize the clusters.\n",
        " - Make a plan to improve on the skills that are missing."
